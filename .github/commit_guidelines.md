# Commit / Pull Request Message Guidelines

In general pull request names are expected to be descriptive and representative of the changes it did and why the
changes were done.

AdsViewer is not insanely dogmatic about quality of pull request messages. But things like `updates` or `initial commit`
are not accepted.

When you pull always make sure to rebase (not just merge) your branch with the latest changes from the main branch. This
mean that when you push you will need to --hard push and that is fine.

We almost always squash commits when merging PRs. This means that you can have as many commits as you want in your PR
with any name you choose. If you choose not to have squashed commits, then the commit messages should follow the same
guidelines as PR messages.
