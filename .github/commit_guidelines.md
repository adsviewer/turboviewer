# Commit Message Guidelines

In general commits are expected to be descriptive and representative of the changes it did and why the changes were done.

AdsViewer is not insanely dogmatic about quality of commit messages. But things like `updates` or `initial commit` are not accepted.

More importantly, if your commit is related to a ticket always include the ticket at the beginning of the commit title like `AV-<number>: <Title>`.
